## spring-boot-learning
This repository contains my journey and hands-on learning with Spring Framework and Spring Boot. It includes sample projects, and idk what to come

Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)
Spring MVC and RESTful Web Services
Spring Boot for rapid application development
Database integration using Spring Data JPA
Spring Security for authentication and authorization
Configuration using application.properties and application.yml
Unit and Integration testing in Spring Boot
The goal of this repository is to document my progress, deepen my understanding of Spring's core concepts, and create a reference guide for future projects or atleast that's what I thought
